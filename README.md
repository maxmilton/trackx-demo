# TrackX Demo

Tools to power a TrackX demo site like <https://demo.trackx.app>. A demo is a full TrackX instance which is read-only and uses a subset of data from a live TrackX instance.

Includes:

- Automation to build the various TrackX apps and modify them for use in the demo:
  - Replace front end app config values that are baked into the output JS.
  - Inject demo banner into front end apps.
  - Inject demo user email and password into the login page inputs.
- TrackX API server plugin which:
  - Initializes a demo database.
  - Replaces tables with views which point to the live database.

Goals:

- Don't add any demo specific things to [the main project](https://github.com/maxmilton/trackx); people who host their own regular instance must have zero impact

## Usage

> Note: Needs the <https://github.com/maxmilton/trackx> files in a directory parallel to this one.

### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Build and pack for production

1. Edit the frontend configuration; `frontend-trackx.config.mjs`.
1. Create a docker compose configuration file from the template and edit:
   ```sh
   cp docker-compose.yml.template docker-compose.yml
   ```
1. Run the build:
   ```sh
   pnpm run setup
   ```
1. Copy the resulting `trackx-demo.tar.gz` file to your server and then follow the normal [TrackX installation instructions](https://docs.trackx.app/#/getting-started/installation.md) but unpack to `/opt/trackx-demo`:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p /opt/trackx-demo && tar -xzf trackx-demo.tar.gz -C /opt/trackx-demo && rm trackx-demo.tar.gz
   ```
1. [SERVER] Create a demo config from the template and edit:
   ```sh
   cp /opt/trackx-demo/etc/demo.config.js.template /opt/trackx-demo/etc/demo.config.js
   ```
1. [SERVER] Create a hard link to the Nginx vhost config:
   ```sh
   ln /opt/trackx-demo/etc/nginx/conf.d/demo.trackx.app.conf /opt/trackx/etc/nginx/conf.d/
   ```
1. Reload Nginx.

### Development

> Set up the parent `trackx` [development environment](https://docs.trackx.app/#/advanced-guides/development.md) first.

```sh
pnpm run setup-dev
```

```sh
pnpm run serve
```

Linting & testing:

```sh
pnpm run lint
```
